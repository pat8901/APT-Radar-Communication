# NOAA APT Signal Decoder

This C program decodes Automatic Picture Transmission (APT) radio signals from NOAA satellites, converting the received signals into weather images. By processing the APT signals, the program extracts and reconstructs the image data, providing weather visualizations from satellite transmissions. Ideal for amateur radio enthusiasts and weather monitoring applications, this decoder leverages signal processing techniques to deliver accurate and detailed images.
