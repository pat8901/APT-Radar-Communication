Automatic Picture Transmission (APT):
1. The satellites encode or modulate image data into a 2400 Hz signal
2. transmitted to earth via a radio wave between 137 and 138 MHz

3. Absolute Value, Cosine and 
Hilbert/FFT are three methods for decoding or demodulating the WAV file into an image.

4. The audio file contains three important frequencies: 2400 Hz, 1040 Hz and 832 Hz
5. The three frequencies carry different information:
    2400 Hz Pixel values (in grayscale) for channel A and B images
    1040 Hz Channel A sync signal
    832 Hz Channel B sync signal

6. For NOAA, ‘words’ means units of information, or pixels. 
This means that there are 909 pixels in each line of Channel A and Channel B respectively.

7. One complete line of data equals 2080 pixels.
8. o determine what the values of these pixels are, it is 
necessary to downsample the audio file from its original sample rate. 

9.  11025 samples per second, and downsamples this information to 4160 samples per second 
(2080 pixels per line in 0.5 seconds × 2 = 4160 pixels per second).

10. Hilbert FFT, this is the most processing-heavy, but most precise, way to decode an 
audio recording of an APT signal into an image.

The process:
=========================
satellite transmitting:
1. instruments collect data
2. data stored as 0 and 1 (digital data, what computers understand)
3. digital data is AM modulated into a baseband signal (2400Hz, 1040Hz, 832Hz)
4. baseband signal is FM modulated into a carrier signal (137MHz and 138MHz depending upon which NOAA satellite)
5. Transmission is sent to ground station

Ground station receiver (sdr):
1. Ground station antenna (sdr) receives FM modulated carrier signal transmission
2. radio receiver (sdr) demodulates FM carrier signal into AM modulated baseband signal

Ground Station decoder (this program)
3. Demodulate Analog AM baseband signal (2400Hz, 1040Hz, 832Hz) to reveal digital data
4. make sure sample rate is 4160 (not sure what step this should occur)
5. interpret digital data to reconstruct 8-bit image
6. save image to a file

(As I understand it currently)
How to demodulate AM baseband 2400Hz signal:
===============================================
1. Remember there are 4160 samples per second. 2 lines per second.
2. Each line is 2080 samples, each sample is a pixel (8-bits).
3. To begin to demodulate the AM baseband 2400Hz signal we need to turn it into I/Q signals.
4. It is unclear to me at what rate should I turn the baseband signal into I/Q signals.
5. Do I pre-process the whole transmission into a I/Q signal, just 1 second, a line, or just per sample.
6. Regardless we can transform into I/Q signals by either doing FIR (Finite Impulse Response filter) 
   with a specific set of coefficients known as a Hilbert Transform, or Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
7. Once we have a I/Q signal the AM demodulation is the absolute value of each pair of points 
   defined as: abs(I_i, Q_i) = sqrt( I_i * I_i + Q_i * Q_i) where I_i and Q_i are the ith samples of the I/Q time series.
8. As of right now I think this may mean that once we take the abs we will get either 1 or 0, i.e., digital data.

to do:
=================
1. get the current sample rate and print
2. change the sample rate to 4160
