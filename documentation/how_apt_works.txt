Automatic Picture Transmission (APT):
1. The satellites encode or modulate image data into a 2400 Hz signal
2. transmitted to earth via a radio wave between 137 and 138 MHz

3. Absolute Value, Cosine and 
Hilbert/FFT are three methods for decoding or demodulating the WAV file into an image.

4. The audio file contains three important frequencies: 2400 Hz, 1040 Hz and 832 Hz
5. The three frequencies carry different information:
    2400 Hz Pixel values (in grayscale) for channel A and B images
    1040 Hz Channel A sync signal
    832 Hz Channel B sync signal

6. For NOAA, ‘words’ means units of information, or pixels. 
This means that there are 909 pixels in each line of Channel A and Channel B respectively.

7. One complete line of data equals 2080 pixels.
8. o determine what the values of these pixels are, it is 
necessary to downsample the audio file from its original sample rate. 

9.  11025 samples per second, and downsamples this information to 4160 samples per second 
(2080 pixels per line in 0.5 seconds × 2 = 4160 pixels per second).

10. Hilbert FFT, this is the most processing-heavy, but most precise, way to decode an 
audio recording of an APT signal into an image.
